/**
 * English language translations for Laravel's pagination component in the AUSTA Integration Platform.
 * Package Version: illuminate/translation ^9.0
 *
 * These translations provide localized text strings for pagination controls and navigation elements
 * used throughout the application. The strings are designed to be screen-reader friendly and
 * support proper accessibility standards.
 *
 * Cultural Considerations:
 * - Uses standard Unicode arrows (« and ») for navigation
 * - Maintains consistent spacing between arrows and text
 * - Supports clear visual navigation indicators
 *
 * Accessibility:
 * - Screen-reader optimized text
 * - RTL-compatible arrow placement
 * - ARIA-label compatible strings
