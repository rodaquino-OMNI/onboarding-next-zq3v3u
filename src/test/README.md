# AUSTA Integration Platform Testing Suite

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the AUSTA Integration Platform, ensuring robust quality assurance across unit, integration, end-to-end, accessibility, performance, security, and compliance testing requirements.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 16.0.0
- npm >= 8.0.0
- Docker for containerized test environments
- Access to test EMR endpoints
- Required global dependencies:
  ```bash
  npm install -g jest cypress @axe-core/cli k6 zaproxy
  ```

## Installation

1. Install test dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Configure environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.test.example .env.test
```

3. Setup test databases:
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up -d
```

## Test Types

### Unit Tests (Jest)

Run unit tests with coverage reporting:
```bash
npm run test:coverage
```

Coverage requirements:
- Statements: 80%
- Branches: 80%
- Functions: 80%
- Lines: 80%

### Integration Tests

Test API and service integrations:
```bash
npm run test:integration
```

Key focus areas:
- EMR system integration (FHIR/HL7)
- Video conferencing services
- Document processing pipeline
- Multi-language support

### End-to-End Tests (Cypress)

Run E2E test suite:
```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

Features:
- Multi-language testing (en, pt-BR)
- Healthcare workflow validation
- Video interview simulation
- Document upload verification

### Accessibility Tests (axe-core)

Validate WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance:
```bash
npm run test:accessibility
```

Focus areas:
- Color contrast for medical information
- Keyboard navigation
- Screen reader compatibility
- Medical terminology pronunciation

### Performance Tests (k6)

Execute load testing scenarios:
```bash
npm run test:performance
```

Requirements:
- Response time: < 1 second
- Uptime: 99.99%
- Concurrent users: 50
- Test duration: 5 minutes

### Security Tests

Run security scans:
```bash
npm run test:security
```

Compliance validation:
- HIPAA requirements
- GDPR compliance
- LGPD standards
- Zero-trust architecture

## Test Scripts

Available npm scripts:
```json
{
  "test": "Run all unit tests",
  "test:coverage": "Run tests with coverage reporting",
  "test:e2e": "Execute end-to-end tests",
  "test:accessibility": "Run accessibility checks",
  "test:performance": "Execute load tests",
  "test:security": "Run security scans"
}
```

## CI/CD Integration

GitHub Actions workflow:
```yaml
test:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: '16'
    - run: npm ci
    - run: npm run test:ci
```

## Test Reports

Reports location:
- Unit test coverage: `/coverage`
- E2E test videos: `/cypress/videos`
- Performance metrics: `/k6-results`
- Security scan reports: `/security-reports`

## Best Practices

1. Test Data Management
   - Use faker.js for healthcare data generation
   - Maintain HIPAA compliance in test data
   - Implement proper data cleanup

2. Healthcare-Specific Testing
   - Validate medical terminology
   - Test multi-language support
   - Verify EMR integration accuracy

3. Security Considerations
   - Encrypt sensitive test data
   - Use secure test environments
   - Follow compliance guidelines

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:
1. Test Database Connection
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml logs db
   ```

2. E2E Test Failures
   ```bash
   cypress run --headed --no-exit
   ```

3. Performance Test Issues
   ```bash
   k6 run --http-debug=full
   ```

## Maintenance

Regular maintenance tasks:
1. Update test dependencies monthly
2. Review and update test data
3. Validate compliance requirements
4. Monitor test coverage metrics
5. Update documentation for new features

- Jest configuration: `jest.config.ts`
- Cypress configuration: `cypress.config.ts`
- Accessibility rules: `accessibility/axe-config.json`
