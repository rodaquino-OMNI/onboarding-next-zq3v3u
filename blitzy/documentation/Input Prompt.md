## **Executive Summary**

THE **AUSTA Integration Platform (AOP)** aims to revolutionize integration in healthcare through a **fully digital, AI-driven and highly engaging** experience. By focusing on **design that puts people first**, this solution will not only simplify complex healthcare enrollment steps, but also ensure empathy, accessibility, and transparency in every user interaction.

This enhanced TSRD (Software Technical Requirements Document) integrates the original architecture with additional recommendations. These include stronger data governance, expanded accessibility measures, and an ever-present focus on user well-being. The final architecture looks like this:

1. **Offers an engaging, frictionless user journey**: Gamified and conversational interfaces make the onboarding process intuitive for individuals, brokers, HR teams, and clinical teams.

2. **Provides highly secure and compliant services**: A zero-trust security framework, robust IAM, and immutable audit trails (on blockchain) ensure data privacy and regulatory compliance (HIPAA, GDPR, LGPD).

3. **Maintains EMR-agnostic integrations**: HAPI FHIR and standardized adapters to handle interoperability with major EMR systems (Epic, Cerner, etc.).

4. **Provides scalable, modular and resilient infrastructure**: Kubernetes-based multi-region deployment (AWS core, GCP disaster recovery), with serverless functions via OpenFaaS and a high-performance data layer supporting real-time analytics.
